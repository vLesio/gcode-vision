      summary: Upload G-code file
      description: |
        Uploads a G-code file (typically with .gcode extension) for the 3D printer simulation engine.
        The file should be sent as `multipart/form-data` using a `file` field.
        File name will be used as a name of the model inside the simulation which is used to refer this model in other methods.
        This does not start the simulation, it only uploads a model that can be later choosen and used in simulation.
